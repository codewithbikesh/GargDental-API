	<meta name="description" content="The smallest focus (0.8mm) in the tube-head makes the images clearer and reduces the X-ray dose by 16-20 times compared with any other products in domestic market. The leaking radiation rate around 1m from focus is close to 0, and the head window is made of 1.5mm aluminum to filter X-ray. As a result, the health of patients and doctors can be protected better.
1. Adopt imported assembled X-ray generator
2. Precise time control: microprocessing can make the exposure time accurate to 1/100 second and display in digital. The machine will replay to any warm immediately.
3. The French imported balance arm make the location flexible and stable.
4. The column is made of aluminium alloy,modern and refined design
5. Parallel focus, contributing to get the super clear image easily
6. With almost no radiation, it&#039;s safe to operate: tiny X ray source and the ball sleeve is tightly sealed. On the condition of opened exposure, around 1 meter from exposure center, its ray leakage lower than national standards by 68 times, more than the prescribed body safety value of 0.5mGy / h is lower (0-0.007mGy / h ). So without X-ray protection room, doctors and patients can be protected well,too.
7. with error code display function, parameters can be reset and saved
8. Voltage stabilizer as standard collocation, preventing the damage from voltage hunting, which can pretend the service life of this machine.
9. Reserved digital camera mode, which can upgrade to digital developing machine
Recommended test after installation:
1. Start the power switch then check the green indicating lamp of system ready status if it is working normally.
2. Choose any exposure time and adjust the position of tube head is good for patient and operator
3. Push the manual switch when you are far from device and check if the yellow X ray indicating lamp is on and buzzer is ringing during exposure
4. When you push the exposure button on the control panel the timer will ring 4 times to indicate the timer is normal
5. To adjust the good position of tube head, you can do following adjustments if necessary:
Adjust the tube head&#039;s tightness by rotating the horizontal axes.
Adjust the tightness of spring of rotating arm
Adjust the frame position a little
6. There should be enough space for operation around the device
7. Please watch your hand during operation or adjust the position
8. If the tube head is obsolete please send to professional recycle company according to the law
9. Don&#039;t stand or put any thing on the pedestal of X-ray unit"/>
